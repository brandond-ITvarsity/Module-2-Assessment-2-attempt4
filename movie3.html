      <p>  Eternals is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics race of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is intended to be the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Chlo√© Zhao and written by Kaz and Ryan Firpo. It stars an ensemble cast including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Don Lee, Kit Harington, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. In the film, the Eternals re-unite, after being in hiding for thousands of years, to protect Earth from the Deviants.

In April 2018, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced that a film based on the Eternals had begun development, with Kaz and Ryan Firpo hired to write the script for the project in May. By late September, Marvel had set Zhao to direct the film. A diverse cast was hired to portray the Eternals, which include Marvel Studios' first depiction of an LGBTQ superhero. Principal photography began in July 2019 at Pinewood Studios, England, with Zhao able to use her own style and film more on location than previous Marvel Studios films. Filming continued until February 2020, with other locations including London and Oxford, England, and the Canary Islands. </p>

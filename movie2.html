      <p> The Lighthouse is a 2019 film directed and produced by Robert Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Max Eggers. A gothic psychological horror[6] film, it was international co-production of the United States and Canada, with the film being shot in black-and-white with a nearly square 1.19:1 aspect ratio. It stars Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as two lighthouse keepers who begin to descend into madness when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed. </p>
        
        <p>The Lighthouse stars Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. They separately approached Robert to express both their enthusiasm for The Witch and a desire to collaborate.[11] Dafoe and Pattinson first met at a party, and Pattinson's participation was used as a selling point in pitches to Dafoe.[12] Their signings were announced separately to the media in February 2018.[13][14] Robert's initial film proposals with Dafoe were not fruitful.[7][12] When they met in person to discuss The Lighthouse, the director was plainspoken in the conversation. Dafoe recalled, "There was no discussion. 'This is the way we're going to do this. My way or the highway.' That's very unusual, especially for a two-hander, for a director to say, 'This is the way I see it. Yes or no?'"[12]

Pattinson and Robert originally met to negotiate terms for an unrelated project. Pattinson was offered, and passed on portraying a Victorian socialite because he believed the role would fail to challenge his acting ability.[7] His next meeting with Robert took place once he finished reading The Lighthouse's completed script. During the conversation, Pattinson showed Robert a clip of an intoxicated man screaming "I am a demon" to convey this understanding of the director's vision.[7]

To prepare for their respective roles, each actor employed different techniques at the rehearsals. Dafoe was spontaneous in his performance, citing his theater background with the experimental troupe The Wooster Group, whereas Pattinson planned his rehearsing from the discussion of the script.
